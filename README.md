üéµ Music Hit Prediction and Recommendation Project üéµ 

By: Semanyoh Nissi Kekeli 

üîç Problem Statement: 
The world of music often faces a challenge - predicting the next big hit. Artists and music agencies sometimes feel in the dark about which tracks will resonate with audiences, leading to missed opportunities and songs that don't hit their potential. 

‚ú® Proposed Solution: 
Introducing my "Music Hit Prediction and Recommendation System"! Leveraging the power of data analytics and machine learning, I aim to shine a light on potential chart-toppers and recommend song elements that truly connect with listeners. 

üöÄ What I Achieved: 

Song Hit Prediction 

Objective: Predict future hit songs from various features. 

Approach: Through detailed data exploration, I homed in on key predictors. After testing multiple algorithms, the Random Forest Classifier stood out for its stellar performance. 

Outcome: My classifier, post-optimization, showcased promising potential in song hit prediction. 

Song Recommendation System 

Objective: Help listeners discover songs based on numerical song features. 

Approach: By pinpointing numerical indicators like tempo and energy, and using cosine distance, I crafted a method to find songs with the closest 'vibe' or similarity. 

Outcome: The system effectively recommends songs, enriching listeners' musical journeys. 

 
‚ö†Ô∏è Considerations/Limitations: 

Music trends are ever evolving; what's hot today might not be tomorrow. 

Music, being an emotional experience, can be influenced by individual moods and sentiments.
